# Live on Linux 

This is my documentation and the source files for the youtube playlist of the same name. If you haven't accessed the playlist yet then [click here](https://youtube.com/playlists/). This folder contains the docs in the form of markdown files. Let me introduce the brief explanation of the contents of the videos that I make in the playlist. The playlist contains the tutorials and explanations for the Linux operating system and related stuff. The playlists contains videos that will explain the Linux term from the base level to an expert level including the knowledge for programmings, server side administrations and hacking / pentesting. There are many more video creators on these topics but I will provide all in one.

## Videos are :-
### (1) Windows Vs Linux - Basics :-
##### The video is part one of three videos where I explain the basic differences between the windows operating system and linux operating system. I am making this foolish discrimination between two popular OS brands, but there's a reason. Windows operating system has been around for so long that almost everyone around the world has been well known to the operating system so much that even the people who have never used a laptop or desktop any once in lifetime would know the name of the operating system.
