## Introduction

The topic of discussion today is about a small theoritical concept and that is __'Brief Introduction to Linux'__ where I am going to discuss about the four main topics :
* History of operating systems
* History of Linux
* Linux as server
* Linux for you

Lets do small talk about these topics

### History of Operating systems
The __Unix__ operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs, in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.

AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix.

The __GNU Project__, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of free software. Work began in 1984. Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU/Hurd, were stalled and incomplete.

### History of Linux
__Linus Torvalds__, frustrated by the licensing of __MINIX__, which at the time limited it to educational use only, he began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the _Linux kernel_. Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems. GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating system.

Adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists, started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where organizations such as NASA started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use began when Dell and IBM, followed by Hewlett-Packard, started offering Linux support to escape Microsoft's monopoly in the desktop operating system market.

Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to virtually all supercomputers, and have secured a place in server installations such as the popular LAMP application stack. Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing. Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices shipping with customized Linux distributions installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for netbooks. Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market, with Android being one of the most dominant operating systems on smartphones and very popular on tablets and, more recently, on wearables.

### Linux as Server
Linux is popularly used in server computers. There are many reasons to this. Some are stated below :-
* Linux is built in such a way that makes it much customizable to use in servers.
* Linux is very secure via its users authentication and Secure shell access.
* Linux is a free and open source operating system that reduces the server charges for the owner company.
* Linux provides a variety of developement and production applications and softwares like PHP backened, python backend, GNU's Apache Server and NGINX reverse proxy.

The above listed are some reasons why people love linux as a server side operating system, Linux also runs on extremely low level of memory. On an average, the linux server versions consumes less than 100MB (~ 70-90MB) on left free. Linux operating systems also maintains swap partition management. Linux also can run on a raspberry pi that makes the local / internal server charges even more lesser. There are popular linux distributions used in servers that are Debian Server, Ubuntu Server, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE, etc.

### Linux for You
Linux was actually developed for usage as a personal computer, but it came out people prefered it more for server side usage as well usage in super computers. This fact does not mean that linux is not suited for personal usage, infact it is best for personal use. Linux almost gets very less support issues. Sometime there are support issues and the reason is due to the local market hardware components, otherwise popular hardware components are very much supported. The linux also has very less hardware requirements, various linux distributions run at extreme low ram, sometimes 1 GigaBytes are enough for a proper usage session. Linux also provides a thousands of free and open source softwares in their package manager list. The installation is very simple and takes just one command, unless we are installing an application from source or with configuration. We can compile our custom kernel also, even without knowing any techy shit, we can use automated operating system with a good decent GUI. There are many linux distributions with well maintained GUI which makes the usage easier for the beginners. The linux kernel is also used in Android operating system which binds the main GUI operating system to the hardware. Thus we use linux everyday, without knowing. The linux terminal may be a bit tech savy in some cases. But nowadays, linux GUI is much simple that usage of terminal is much lesser. Linux environment is also best for programming and developement. By default, linux uses vim editor which is like a god level code editor. Also there are linux builts for sublime, VS code and Atom. For image editing and graphical designing, there are softwares like GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). There are tools for a home local testing server like GNU's apache and NGINX. People who are interested in cybersecurity firm can use the kali linux or parrot OS. Linux are also used in arduino gadgets and pi computers. Thus, linux can be used everywhere.
